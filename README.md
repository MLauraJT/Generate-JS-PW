# Generate-JS-PW

## Feeble Description

This project was an intent to better understand and utilize javascript, to figure out what makes the website run with rudimentary coding. While I was able to understand some commands, I struggled with others and thus unfortunately fell short of the entirety of the website coming together.

## Aside Description

I changed the colors of my website, and I was able to apply question boxes, but other than that not much is happening
